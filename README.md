# 📞 Telecom Customer Churn Prediction
*Fresher Data Science Project | Machine Learning Pipeline*

## 📌 Project Overview
I developed a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a telecom company. By identifying at-risk customers, the business can implement retention strategies to reduce revenue loss.

## 🚀 Key Results
- **Model:** Tuned Random Forest Classifier.
- **Performance:** **84% Accuracy** and **87% Recall** for the churn class.
- **Optimization:** Used **GridSearchCV** to handle overfitting and **SMOTE** to handle class imbalance.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Preprocessing:** Standard Scaler, One-Hot Encoding, SMOTE

## 📈 Top Insights
1. **Contract Type:** Month-to-month customers are the most likely to churn.
2. **Tenure:** Customers are most vulnerable to leaving within their first 6 months.
3. **Charges:** High monthly charges correlate strongly with churn intent.
